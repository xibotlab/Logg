# Logg
Logg is the social network service from Moonlab.
Logg is similar to Twitter, but it's good for logging something.

## Installing Code
Before starting, install Python 3. Logg uses Python Flask, the web framework.
Just install Python 3 on <a href="https://python.org" target="_blank">Python homepage</a>

After installing Python3, enter this in terminal:
```
pip install flask pymysql
```
This command will install packages in Logg.

After installing Flask and other packages, finally you can download source code and run.
The easiest way is to go to your work directory and enter this:
```
git clone https://github.com/xibotlab/logg.git
```
This command will copy the repository and save it into your directory.

Almost done, MySQL is required. Install MySQL and add `dbpw.txt`.
add the root password in `dbpw.txt`.

Finally, just run app.py.
Than go to localhost:5000, and done!
