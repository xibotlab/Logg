# Logg
Logg is the social network service from Moonlab.

## Running
These services are required.
<ul>
 <li>Python</li>
</ul>
After installing those services, enter this on your workspace.

```
pip install flask
git clone https://github.com/xibotlab/logg.git
```

This command will install Flask, and clone direcotry.
Go to the cloned directory and run app.py.

Unfortunately, this service will just display the screen. DB will not work.
